1. Quickly generate an illustrated list/collection of **ten** (10) ideas. Keep each idea simple, draw whatever comes to mind first. Do not worry about whether the ideas are good or not. They just need to be simple and different than each other

2. Revise your list so that only **five** (5) revisions remain. Do not think too hard about this, just quickly eliminate each idea you **do not** like until only ten are remaining in your collection

3. Make a new version of your illustrated list / collection, this time of your remaining **five** (5) ideas

4. Pick **one** (1) of those remaining **five** (5) ideas to actually pursue / make
