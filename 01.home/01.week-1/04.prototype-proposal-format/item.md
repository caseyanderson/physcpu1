You will be required to write a prototype proposal for each of the briefs you complete in this class. You can think of this as a tool to help organize your thoughts as you work through your ideas week-by-week. Prototype proposals will be treated as homework which you will be asked to edit and resubmit as your prototype evolves. Upon completion of a prototype you must also deliver every draft of your proposal (labeled by date).

## Proposal Format
Your proposal must contain the following components:
* **Title** giving your prototype a title sometimes helps you prioritize focusing on certain things over others. This may change throughout the completion of the prototype
* **Inspiration** where did your idea come from? What lead you to this particular idea? What about this is interesting to you (specifically) and why?
* **Experience Category** what is your prototype? A tool? Game? Puzzle? Scale model of an installation? Something else?
* **Invitation** How do you invite someone to use your prototype with a povocative, one sentence statement?
* **Demo Sequence** A numbered list describing specifically what a user does during your demo in order
* **Learning Outcome** What idea do you want to leave your user with as a result of experiencing your demo?
* **Materials** what do you need to make this prototype? List the materials here
* **Supporting Media** in the early stages this will be sketches / images, for the final version students will be required to produce a "proof of functionality" video

Proposals should be delivered as PDF files of approximately 1 to 2 pages in length divided into the categories listed above. Over the course of each prototype you will “fill in” parts of your proposal that are not yet complete/finalized.
