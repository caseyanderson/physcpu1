# HSCI-214: Physical Computing 1

* Instructor: Casey Anderson
* Email: {{ casey.anderson ]]] @ [[ artcenter.edu }}}
* Pronouns: he / him / his
* Class Meetings: Thursdays, 09:00AM – 11:50AM

## Description
This prototyping-oriented course introduces students to the creative affordances of physical computing, or the practice of interfacing digital systems with the outside world, by way of hands-on experiments across a range of technologies. Students will learn programming concepts (Python 3), and basic electronics, as well as strategies for their interaction, by designing interactive objects and experiences in response to a series of prototype briefs. Regular critiques will provide an opportunity for students to share their prototypes with their colleagues as well as receive direct feedback from the instructor.

## Grading Policy
Grades will be calculated based on the following distribution:
* Attendance = 10%
* Lab participation = 20%
* Homework assignments = 35%
* Prototypes = 35%

If something comes up and you need to miss class please send me an email saying so. A simple "I had to miss class" is sufficient, I do not need the details.

## Goals
1. Construct simple circuits to interface electronics with digital systems
2. Learn and explore the basic principles of software design
3. Prototype experiences and devices across a continuum of technologies
