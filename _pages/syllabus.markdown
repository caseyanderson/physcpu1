### Description

This prototyping-oriented class introduces students to the creative affordances of physical computing, or the practice of interfacing digital system with the outside world, by way of hands-on experiments across a continuum of technologies. Students will learn programming concepts (Python3), and basic electronics, as well as strategies for their interaction, via the [HUZZAH32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405). Regular critiques will provide an opportunity for students to share their research and prototypes with their colleagues as well as receive direct feedback from the instructor.
