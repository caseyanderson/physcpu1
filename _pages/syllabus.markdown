### Description

This prototyping-oriented class introduces students to the creative affordances of physical computing, or the practice of interfacing digital system with the outside world, by way of hands-on experiments across a continuum of technologies. Students will learn programming concepts (Python3), and basic electronics, as well as strategies for their interaction, via the [HUZZAH32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405). Regular critiques will provide an opportunity for students to share their research and prototypes with their colleagues as well as receive direct feedback from the instructor.

### Grading Policy

Grades will be calculated based on the following distribution:

* Attendance = 15%
* Lab participation = 15%
* Homework assignments = 35%
* Prototypes = 35%


### Attendance Policy

Absences will be excused if and only if I am notified via email prior to the beginning of class. Failure to do so will result in an unexcused absence. 3 unexcused absences will result in an automatic F in this class. If your absence is excused, we will work out a way for you to make up as much of the in-class activities as possible.


### Goals

1. Construct simple circuits to interface electronics with digital systems
2. Learn and explore the basic principles of software design
3. Prototype experiences and devices across a continuum of technologies
