I"¸<p>You will be required to write a prototype proposal for each of the briefs you complete in this class. You can think of this as a tool to help organize your thoughts as you work through your ideas week-by-week. Prototype proposals will be treated as homework which you will be asked to edit and resubmit as your prototype evolves. Upon completion of a prototype you must also deliver every version of your proposal (labeled by date).</p>
