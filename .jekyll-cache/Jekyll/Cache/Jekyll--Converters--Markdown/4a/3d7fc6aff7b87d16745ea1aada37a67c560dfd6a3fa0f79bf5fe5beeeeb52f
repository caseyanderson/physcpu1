<p>Create a prototype in which an audience member/user is prompted to interact with a disguised/hidden/DIY button (i.e. not-button) in order to toggle between two possible outputs. While the specifics are up to you one general goal for this project is to create a context/story that incentivizes interaction with your prototype.</p>

<p>Key question: why is this interesting to someone other than me and how can I make this experience as memorable as possible for the audience/user?</p>
