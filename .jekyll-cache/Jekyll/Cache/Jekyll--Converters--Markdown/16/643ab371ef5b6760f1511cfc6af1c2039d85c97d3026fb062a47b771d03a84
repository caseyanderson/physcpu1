<p>Create a prototype in which an audience member/user is prompted to interact with at least two sensors in order to control/change at least two possible outputs. While the specifics are up to you one general goal for this project is to create a context/story that incentivizes interaction with your prototype.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>target platform: ESP32</li>
  <li>has at least two inputs (at least one must be an analog sensor)</li>
  <li>has at least two outputs (at least one must use a TIP120)</li>
  <li>prompts or rewards audience/user interaction (sensor input results in a significant change/output)</li>
  <li>relationship between the sensors, and the interactions associated with each, fits into the larger context of the prototype</li>
  <li>document final deployment, present to class as a video</li>
</ul>
