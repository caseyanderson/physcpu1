<p>Combine / remix a technological feature developed for your first prototype with a technological feature developed for your second prototype in order to create a new (third) prototype. While the specifics are up to you, your remixed prototype should prompt an audience member/user to interact with two sensors in order to control/change two unique outputs.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>target platform: ESP32</li>
  <li>has two unique inputs (at least one must be an analog sensor)</li>
  <li>has two unique outputs (printing to the console does not count as an output this time)</li>
  <li>prompts or rewards audience/user interaction (sensor input results in a significant change/output)</li>
  <li>significantly makes use of technology you developed from both of your previous prototypes to produce something new</li>
  <li>relationship between the sensors, and the interactions associated with each, fits into the larger context of the prototype</li>
  <li>document final deployment, present to class as a video</li>
</ul>
