Buttons tend to have one of two different actuation styles:

* momentary
* toggle

Using only cardboard, and aluminum (or conductive) tape, construct two DIY buttons, one that is momentary and another that toggles. Your goal is to be able to use both of these buttons to control an LED. Be prepared to demonstrate your buttons next week in class to receive credit.
