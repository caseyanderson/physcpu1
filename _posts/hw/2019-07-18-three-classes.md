Using the `Person()` class as a template, create 3 (three) classes of your own design. Each class should contain the following features:

* 1x `constructor method` with at least 4 Instance Variables
* 3x `instance methods`, where 1 is modeled after the `description()` `instance method` from the `Person()` class and the other two are your own design
