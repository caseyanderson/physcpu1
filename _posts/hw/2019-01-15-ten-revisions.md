1. Following your test deployments, quickly generate a written list of Twenty (20) possible revisions to your project (don't think too hard about each idea yet, generate a bunch of them first without regard to whether they are "good" ideas or not).

2. Next, revise your list so that only the ten (10) best revisions remain. Revisions could include changing the looping media, installing the screen/speaker outdoors in a different way, or other things that result in potentially productive changes to your project.

3. You will need to email me a `pdf` of your 10 revisions by the beginning of next week's class in order to receive credit for this assignment.
