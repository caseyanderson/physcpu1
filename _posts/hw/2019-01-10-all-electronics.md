[All Electronics](https://www.allelectronics.com/) is one of the last brick-and-mortar electronics stores in the greater Los Angeles area. Even better, it is a surplus store that purchases overstock components from manufacturers at a discount price. In other words, they are the last local source for cheap components. Whenever I prototype **anything** I start by going to All Electronics to see how much of the required components I can get there before ordering things online (shipping is so expensive and slow!).

In order to receive credit for this assignment you must:
1. go to All Electronics (don't drive/have a car? consider carpooling with a colleague!)
2. purchase the four items on the Required Materials list (see the syllabus) from All Electronics
3. bring the items you acquired from All Electronics to class next week
