1. Following your tests, quickly generate a written list of Twenty (20) possible revisions to your project (don't think too hard about each idea yet, generate a bunch of them first without regard to whether they are "good" ideas or not).

2. Next, revise your list so that only the ten (10) best revisions remain.

3. Pick one of thoes ideas to incorporate in the next iteration of your prototype.

Note: submit a `pdf` of your 10 revision and indicate which revision you selected
