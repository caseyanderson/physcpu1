## brief

Create a prototype in which an audience member/user is prompted to interact with a disguised/hidden/DIY button (i.e. not-button) in order to toggle between two possible outputs. While the specifics are up to you one general goal for this project is to create a context/story that incentivizes interaction with your prototype.

Key question: why is this interesting to someone other than me and how can I make this experience as memorable as possible for the audience/user?


### requirements

* target platform: ESP32
* has two possible outputs
* allows audience/user to control outputs (button press/presses)
* prompts or rewards audience/user interaction (button press results in a significant change/output)
* uses one disguised/hidden/DIY button
* deployed in public (multiple times, document all deployments)
* document final public deployment, present to class as a video
