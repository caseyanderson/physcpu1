Regardless of platform all students in this class will use the following tools:

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
* [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/index.html)

Nonetheless, setting up a Python3 development environment (i.e. being able to use these tools to program) requires slightly different procedures:

* Go [ here ](https://gist.github.com/caseyanderson/0c1f508acaac2f2afd77966af44f7dee) for instructions regarding installing tools needed for general development with Python3 under **MacOS** (via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/))
* Go [ here ](https://gist.github.com/caseyanderson/6030e04ff59acafa6f016b45ff505c94) for instructions regarding installing tools needed for general development with Python3 under **Windows 10** (via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/))
