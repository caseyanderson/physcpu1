### Description

from fieldwork class: This prototyping-oriented class leads students through numerous open-ended, small-to-mid-scale design briefs in the Raspberry Pi 3 development environment. Students will explore environmentally deployed embedded media, surveillance techniques, and intermediate interaction strategies as a means to establish computer literacy in an always-connected, internet-of-things context. Simultaneously, students will learn strategies for designing a prototype for public deployment and social engagement. Regular critiques will provide an opportunity for students to share their research and prototypes with their colleagues as well as receive direct feedback from the instructor.


old copy (likely written by Bruce): The leading edge of design is becoming increasingly high tech. Microprocessors are enabling designers to incorporate both sophisticated behaviors and intelligent user interfaces into their products. This class will introduce students to a modern, low-cost microprocessor, the Arduino, and teach the core electronic sciences required to use it to control interactive design. This class assumes no prior knowledge of electronics, although students should have basic mathematical skills.

### Required Materials

* Laptop (Mac)
* [Adafruit HUZZAH32 – ESP32 Feather Board (pre-soldered)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3591)
* [USB cable - USB A to Micro-B - 3 foot long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/592)

### Grading Policy

Grades will be calculated based on the following distribution:

* Attendance = 10%
* Lab participation = 20%
* Homework assignments = 35%
* Prototypes = 35%

Late prototype/assignment policy: for every week a prototype/assignment is late its highest possible grade drops by a letter.


### Goals

1. Construct simple circuits to interface electronics with digital systems
2. Learn and explore the basic principles of software design
3. Prototype experiences and devices across a continuum of technologies

### Attendance Policy

Attending class is critical to learning this material. We have a lot to cover and will have to move pretty quickly to get through it all.

Absences will be excused if and only if I am notified via email prior to the beginning of class. Failure to do so will result in an unexcused absence. 3 unexcused absences will result in an automatic F in this class. If your absence is excused, we will work out a way for you to make up as much of the in-class activities as possible.
