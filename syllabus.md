### Goals


### Attendance Policy

Attending class is critical to learning this material. We have a lot to cover and will have to move pretty quickly to get through it all.

Absences will be excused if and only if I am notified via email prior to the beginning of class. Failure to do so will result in an unexcused absence. 3 unexcused absences will result in an automatic F in this class. If your absence is excused, we will work out a way for you to make up as much of the in-class activities as possible.
