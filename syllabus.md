## Physical Computing 1
### HSCI-214-01, Art Center College of Design
Class Meetings: Thursdays, 09:00AM – 11:50AM, Room 340, 1111 S. Arroyo Parkway

Office Hours: Tuesdays, 09:00AM - 10:50AM, Room 315, 1111 S. Arroyo Parkway

Email: casey.anderson@artcenter.edu


### Description

This prototyping-oriented class introduces students to the creative affordances of physical computing, or the practice of interfacing digital system with the outside world, by way of hands-on experiments across a continuum of technologies. Students will learn programming concepts (Python3), and basic electronics, as well as strategies for their interaction, via the [HUZZAH32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405). Regular critiques will provide an opportunity for students to share their research and prototypes with their colleagues as well as receive direct feedback from the instructor.


### Required Materials

* Laptop (Mac or PC)
* [Adafruit HUZZAH32 – ESP32 Feather Board (pre-soldered)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3591)
* [USB cable - USB A to Micro-B - 3 foot long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/592)

### Grading Policy

Grades will be calculated based on the following distribution:

* Attendance = 10%
* Lab participation = 20%
* Homework assignments = 35%
* Prototypes = 35%

Late prototype/assignment policy: for every week a prototype/assignment is late its highest possible grade drops by a letter.


### Goals

1. Construct simple circuits to interface electronics with digital systems
2. Learn and explore the basic principles of software design
3. Prototype experiences and devices across a continuum of technologies


### Attendance Policy

Attending class is critical to learning this material. We have a lot to cover and will have to move pretty quickly to get through it all.

Absences will be excused if and only if I am notified via email prior to the beginning of class. Failure to do so will result in an unexcused absence. 3 unexcused absences will result in an automatic F in this class. If your absence is excused, we will work out a way for you to make up as much of the in-class activities as possible.
