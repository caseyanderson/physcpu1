### Description

This prototyping-oriented class introduces students to the creative affordances of physical computing, or the practice of interfacing digital system with the outside world, by way of hands-on experiments across a continuum of technologies. Students will learn programming concepts (Python3), and basic electronics, as well as strategies for their interaction, via the [HUZZAH32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405). Regular critiques will provide an opportunity for students to share their research and prototypes with their colleagues as well as receive direct feedback from the instructor.


### Required Materials

* Laptop (Mac or PC)

### Grading Policy

Grades will be calculated based on the following distribution:

* Attendance = 15%
* Lab participation / Weekly Quizzes = 15%
* Homework assignments = 35%
* Prototypes = 35%

Late prototype / assignment policy: for every week a prototype/assignment is late its highest possible grade drops by a letter.


### Goals

1. Construct simple circuits to interface electronics with digital systems
2. Learn and explore the basic principles of software design
3. Prototype experiences and devices across a continuum of technologies

### Weekly Quiz Policy

Beginning Week 2 every class will start with a short quiz, available from the start of class (9:00AM) for ten minutes (until 9:10AM). Those arriving to class after 9:10AM will receive a zero on the quiz.
