Get into groups of two and recreate the 1x Button 2x LEDs demo using only cardboard and conductive tape for the button input. One must be a toggle button, the other a momentary button. Each group will demo their designs for the class with the [1x Button 2x LEDs](https://physcpu1.caseyanderson.com/labs/one-button-two-LEDs.html) demo from our lab last week, i.e. they both must be capable of turning an LED on through your Huzzah32.
